## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:
16  out of 20
## Self-Reflection:
The majority of the assigment was easy to code, since I'm more familiar with HTML and Css. I did hit a bump on the Javascript part. Even after copying and editing the js file. When I open the site on chrome, it would let me enter one message and send it, then the chat changed but wouldn't let me send another message. After discussing with some of my peers, I realized that I had some things like the setInterval and the URl out of order hence why it kept running into that issue. After changing my code and running a few more tests, the chat works as intended to where I can send a message at the setInterval. Dunno how to work around that skipped test though.
### How long it took me to finish this?
Since I started the assignment Earlier I'd say 4-6 days.
